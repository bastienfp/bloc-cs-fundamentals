1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;
SET coffeeMakerCoffeeCompartment = 0
SET coffeeMakerWater = 0
GET coffee
GET spoon
SET coffeeAmount
IF Temp < coffeeAmount THEN
	SET coffeeSpoon = spoon + coffee
	coffeeMakerCoffeeCompartment = coffeeMakerCoffeeCompartment + coffeeSpoon
	INCREMENT coffeeMakerWater
	DECREMENT coffeeAmount
ENDIF
SET isCoffeeMakerOn = true
GET coffeeMug


Washing dishes;

GET soap
GET sponge
INIT soapySponge
SET isTapOn = true
WHILE (plates != 0)
	USE soapySponge to wash plate
END WHILE
SET isTapOn = false


A choice of your own.
Brushing teeth

GET toothbrush
GET toothpaste
SET toothbrushReady = toothbrush + toothpaste
SET timer to 2 minutes
WHILE (timer > 0)
	USE toothbrushReady to Brush teeth
END WHILE
ClEAN toothbrushReady


2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

Answer:
- Amazon distribution algorithm made them successful. The small time-lapse between a customer ordering and receiving its product at the destination of its choice defines Amazon today.

- Crocs shoe design algorithm made them successful and distinctive. The unmistakable design and comfort of their shoes made Crocs renowned worldwide.

- Ikea shopping experience made them globally successful. Their product and stores are uniquely design to enjoy and facilitate shopping for furnitures.

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

Answer:
An efficient algorithm takes less time to produce a solution.
An efficient algorithm tests many edge cases to produce a more complete/robust solution.
An efficient algorithm involves less steps to produce a solution.
